# 🎮 Jump and Run (SFML 3)

A simple 2D platformer built with **C++** and **SFML 3**.

This project was created to practice:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Game Loop architecture
- Basic 2D physics (gravity & jumping)
- Clean C++ project structure
- Git & GitHub workflow

---

## 🎯 Features

- Player movement (A / D)
- Jumping (Space)
- Gravity system
- Ground collision
- Structured architecture (Game / Player / Level separation)

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- C++
- SFML 3
- Visual Studio
- Git

---

## 🎮 Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| A   | Move Left |
| D   | Move Right |
| Space | Jump |

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- Separating logic from rendering
- Using velocity instead of direct position changes
- Handling basic collision detection
- Organizing a C++ game project properly

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Multiple platforms
- Collision system improvements
- Camera system
- Animations
- DeltaTime (frame independent movement)
- Level system
